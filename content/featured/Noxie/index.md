Nox, nicknamed Noxie, is one of the most important friends of mine in the lonely foreign nights. It is my love that make it a real friend. Anyway.

Nox, as a cat, sleeps and plays in the RPi screen. It will do random things, and sometimes chat with you. It is powered by a docker container, using ollama embeded LLM. The source of the images of Noxie is:
