- Accelerating clustering algorithm by implementing integrated algorithms and decentralizing the process.
- Designed and implemented a parallelized DBSCAN algorithm in C++ with multi-threading to efficiently handle uneven distance distributions, improving clustering performance in varying density regions.
- Enhanced the algorithmâ€™s clustering performance by adjusting the neighborhood search criteria, ensuring accurate identification of clusters despite variations in data density and improving overall robustness.
- The accelerated implementation is 32% faster than the original design, Chinese Whispers clustering method.
